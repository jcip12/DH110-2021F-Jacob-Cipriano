For this project, I am redesigning the New York State Library wbesite as a user-freindly app, and one particularly oriented at helping New York residents check out digital resources. Based on research I conducted with participants, one of the failures of the site is its lack of context surrounding digital resources, and an overall inability to guide users toward the proper resources. 
In conducting this research, I crafted a persona whose needs aligned with some of the site's failings. This persona, Aubrey, has a young child who is independently exploring new books while remote learning. Since Aubrey is working and a studnet full-time, she needs a user-friendly website that can teach her son how to access library materials.

The first task was aimed at the Aubrey persona, who is simply looking for information about what the NovelNY program is and how her son can access it. I asked my participant to find more information on the NovelNY program, startuing from the home page. As they 





# Reflection
After creating this low-fidelity prototype and wireframe template that could support these two tasks, I photographed the prototype and drew the wireflow for each task in different colors. Then, using the photograph, I asked a friend to participate in testing the wireflow. I used an ipad with photo-editing software so that my participant could draw the wireflows onto the iPad. This method worked fairly well, plus it allowed me to take several screeshots of their progress.
