# Project Description
The purpose and goal of this study was to explore the usability of the New York State Library website, along with its design and layout, particularly relating to its function in conducting genealogical research. In order to conduct this study, I created an interview script and various research questions, then created an ideal participant and found someone for the study who fit the description. Genealogy is the study of ancestry, particularly family trees. The website for the New York State Library is not primarily a hub for this type of research, however it is available and is one of the many features that are not obviously an aspect of the site. The website can be found here:

https://www.nysl.nysed.gov/

My goal is to find issues with the NYSL website, especially regarding design, formatting, layout, and searchability. 

## Target Users
Since this particular inquiry involved the genealogical research available through the NYSL, my target audeince is one who would be interested in genealogy, has perhaps done some prior research into family trees, but wants help when finding more information. Ideally, users would require no expertise in the subject, as I'm hoping to capture a new user's understanding of the website layout. I'm also taking into consideration that those interested in genealogical research may be adults of all ages, however those using something like a State Library for research may be older. My participant in this study is in his twenties, however he fits an ideal candidate in every other way. 

## Research Method
For this study, I used the Participatory Research method, conducting the interview over the phone with a friend who lives in another state. He fits nearly all of my requirements for an ideal target user, excpet that he is relatively young. This sytem of research allows me to observe the participant's interaction with the activity, mainly by listening to their spoken thoughts and interjecting with follow-up questions when more information is needed. 

### Contextual Inquiry Guide (script)
This acted as the foundation for the interview, allowing the conversation to evolve away from the initial questions, but always offering a point of return when the topic shifted.

### Audio Interview Recording
This was conducted on Tuesday, October 18th over the phone. Audio was captured with a lavalier mic attached to the end of an iPhone, recorded with another 1Phone.

# Reflection and Insights
The interview went much faster than I anticipated, with the participant actively sharing his thoughts and engaging with the website with enthusiasm. In finding another user for this particulr study, I may look for someone less tech-familiar, as this participant is especially internet-connected in most of his hobbies and has taken a web design class in college. The fact that he had taken a web design class in college was unknown to me until the middlee of the interview, however it was a double-edged sword. On one hand, it meant he was very familiar with the topic we discussed and knew how to speak eloquently about the design of the website. On the other hand, my particiapnt may have had too much of an upper-hand over the task, whereas a less experienced user may have had a more difficult time and could have brought more knowledge regarding new users. Perhaps most shocking to me was my participant's rating of the user experience and web design. He rated it 9/10, with 10 being very easy to use and 1 being very difficult to use. He said that the website was "easy to navigate" and "simple" however had some formatting problems. His main gripe with the website was the way the information was presented about genealogy, though he had no issue finding the topic. He said that the information was like a wall of text, hard to understand, and too cluttered. He liked the dropdown elements of the main menu and wished that the "Collections" section had a similar feature so that each part could be better segmented and organized. 

Perhaps the most valuable thing I learned from this interview was that when conducted conversationally, the topic could bring totally new insights to the research. Also, I learned that often my pre-prepared questions became adequate or redundant, depending on what my interviewee said. Sometimes we would cover a topic before a formal question, so I had to improvise and adapt on the spot. Throughout the interview, his feedback gave me ideas for new questions to ask, which I did. Next time when conducting an interview for user research, I'll be sure to trust my gut more and to allow the conversation to move freely. By the end of my interview with this participant, he was sharing all sorts of impressions and insights about the website layout, the organization, the effectiveness of the website, etc. Many of these insights I would not have asked him about in the first place. I found this experience extremely valuable and I think that conducting user research in this method is particularly useful when starting to research a topic, as it may open new avenues for investigation that weren't before considered.
