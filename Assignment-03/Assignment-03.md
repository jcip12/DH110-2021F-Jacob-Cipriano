# Project Description
The purpose and goal of this study was to explore the usability

https://www.nysl.nysed.gov/

My goal is to find issues with the NYSL website, especially regarding design, formatting, layout, and searchability. 

## Target Users
Since this particular inquiry involved the genealogical research available through the NYSL, my target audeince is one who would be interested in genealogy, has perhaps done some prior research into family trees, but wants help when finding more information. Ideally, users would require no expertise in the subject, as I'm hoping to capture a new user's understanding of the website layout. I'm also taking into consideration that those interested in genealogical research may be adults of all ages, however those using something like a State Library for research may be older. My participant in this study is in his twenties, however he fits an ideal candidate in every other way. 

## Research Method
For this study, I used the Participatory Research method, conducting the interview over the phone with a friend who lives in another state. He fits nearly all of my requirements for an ideal target user, excpet that he is relatively young. This sytem of research allows me to observe the participant's interaction with the activity, mainly by listening to their spoken thoughts and interjecting with follow-up questions when more information is needed. 

### Contextual Inquiry Guide (script)
This acted as the foundation for the interview, allowing the conversation to evolve away from the initial questions, but always offering a point of return when the topic shifted.

# Reflection and Insights


Perhaps the most valuable thing I learned from this interview was that when conducted conversationally, the topic could bring totally new insights to the research. 

Also, I learned that often my pre-prepared questions became adequate or redundant, depending on what my interviewee said. Sometimes we would cover a topic before a formal question, so I had to improvise and adapt on the spot. Throughout the interview, his feedback gave me ideas for new questions to ask, which I did. Next time when conducting an interview for user research, I'll be sure to trust my gut more and to allow the conversation to move freely. By the end of my interview with this participant, he was sharing all sorts of impressions and insights about the website layout, the organization, the effectiveness of the website, etc. Many of these insights I would not have asked him about in the first place. I found this experience extremely valuable and I think that conducting user research in this method is particularly useful when starting to research a topic, as it may open new avenues for investigation that weren't before considered.
