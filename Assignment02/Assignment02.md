# Assignment02 Usability Testing

### Introduction and the purpose of UT
The purpose of this assignment was to conduct a pilot test for the usability testing of the New York State Library website (https://www.nysl.nysed.gov/), which serves the State of New York as a research hub for Librarians, Government employees, and New Yorkers. Usability testing 
I previously conducted a heuristic evaluation of the website, to discover several usability issues, several of which I chose to test in this assignment: 
-The website does not have an intuitive, minimalist layout
-The website has little in the way of error prevention. Often a person can click on a tab or link without being aware they are redirected to another website.
-There is little information designed to help new visitors to the website or those new to the library system.
With these issues in mind, I conducted a test of three actions. One involved finding information about library cards, one involved finding information about digital rentals, and another involved contacting the Research Library.

### Process and Materials
I conducted the test with a participant in my kitchen at on a quiet evening. I recorded the participant's computer screen as she performed the three tasks that would help me evaluate the website usability. I used my Sony Handycam to record her reactions to the test, then paired the screen recording and the reaction video in Adobe Premiere and exported them as one file. I had the UT form on an iPad so that it could be easily handed between the two of us. I chose to give the participant as little prior information as possible, hoping that they could rely on their prior knowledge (if any) of public library websites. My pre-test questions primarily involved the participant's prior knowledge of the library system and how often they used their own public library.

## Summary and Reflection
Following the usability test, I made a few notes about the success of the test and what I hoped to improve in the future. It became a small challenge deciding which parts of the UT form should be read aloud or should be allowed for the user to read privately. Some of the questions I asked may have been easier to evaluate had the participant seen the questions in front of their own eyes. I adapted throughout the test by asking questions verbally, then allowing the participant to read over their selections. There were several times when I figured the participant should read the form on their own (for example, the release form and the demographic questions). When conducting this test again, I would make sure to have a copy of the form to read alongside the participant, while they read their own. 

I found it very challenging not to participate in the test witn the participant, as it seemed all too easy for me to guide them as to what to do next. Some of these questions may help me in designing a better UT test, however. I found that the test would've been much stronger had I set certain perameters around the activities (for example, I could have said "if you ever leave the main NYSL website, let me know and return to the home page"). 

Overall, the UT pilot test told me about the primary weaknesses in the website. Finding certain tasks were relatively easy for the participant (such as requesting access to Special Colections), however the biggest issue was the cluttered webpage design and the lack of general information for basic functions. For example, finding information about NovelNY was basically impossible for the participant without going to another website. There is an image link for NovelNY on the homepage, but no information about what the program is. I found that the main issues regarding this website is a lack of context for newer visitors. The site is tailored more to those very familiar with what they need, perhaps they are professionals or librarians themselves. I look forward to using this information to design a smoother, more content-related Usability Test in the future.
