# Assignment02 Usability Testing
---

### Introduction and the purpose of UT
The purpose of this assignment was to conduct a pilot test for the usability testing of the New York State Library website (https://www.nysl.nysed.gov/), which serves the State of New York as a research hub for Librarians, Government employees, and New Yorkers. Usability testing 
I previously conducted a heuristic evaluation of the website, to discover several usability issues, several of which I chose to test in this assignment: 
-The website does not have an intuitive, minimalist layout
-The website has little in the way of error prevention. Often a person can click on a tab or link without being aware they are redirected to another website.
-There is little information designed to help new visitors to the website or those new to the library system.
With these issues in mind, I conducted a test of three actions. One involved finding information about library cards, one involved finding information about digital rentals, and another involved contacting the Research Library.

### Process and Materials
I conducted the test with a participant in my kitchen at on a quiet evening. I recorded the participant's computer screen as she performed the three tasks that would help me evaluate the website usability. I used my Sony Handycam to record her reactions to the test, then paired the screen recording and the reaction video in Adobe Premiere and exported them as one file. I had the UT form on an iPad so that it could be easily handed between the two of us. I chose to give the participant as little prior information as possible, hoping that they could rely on their prior knowledge (if any) of public library websites. My pre-test questions primarily involved the participant's prior knowledge of the library system and how often they used their own public library.
