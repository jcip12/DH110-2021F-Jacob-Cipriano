# Assignment02 Usability Testing
---

### Introduction and the purpose of UT
The purpose of this assignment was to conduct a pilot test for the usability testing of the New York State Library website (https://www.nysl.nysed.gov/), which serves the State of New York as a research hub for Librarians, Government employees, and New Yorkers. 
I previously conducted a heuristic evaluation of the website, to discover several usability issues, several of which I chose to test in this assignment:

### Process and Materials
I conducted the test with a participant in my kitchen at on a quiet evening. I recorded the participant's computer screen as she performed the three tasks that would
help me evaluate the website usability. I used my Sony Handycam to record her reactions to the test, then paired the screen recording and the reaction video in Adobe Premiere
and exported them as one file.
