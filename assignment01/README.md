### Assignment01: Heuristic Evaluation of New York

---
## Purpose

This assignment is a study of the heuristic evaluations of two New York State websites in order to evaluate them for usability. After testing several core tasks, I used Jakob Nielson's ten principles for usable design to discover what elements needed improvement in each site. After finding flaws in their usability, I intend to improve the user design of theses websites throughout this course.
