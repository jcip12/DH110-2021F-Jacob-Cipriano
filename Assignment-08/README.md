## Introduction: a brief information about the project. 
The puprose of this project is to redesign the New York State Library Website into a mobile-app focused on accessibility and access to resources. I was motivated to design an app for this website because I noticed several issues, primarily regarding acessibility. It felt like the website was easy to use for those already familiar with the resources, but for those looking for new access to infomration, the process could by labyrinthine and sometimes information could not be easily accessed. 

I designed  a web app that would make it easier to learn about two main functions, the NovelNY program and the Genealogy stystem. I am basing these activities on the personas of two individuals: one who is a mother looking to educate her son about NovelNY, and another who is an older man looking to start consrtucting a family tree.
I hope that this can contribute to the New York State Library by demonstrating an effective way to display and communicate information to a new audience. .

## Design statement 
Through this design prototype, I hope to         What is the issue and Why do you think it is important to resolve that issue by your project?
