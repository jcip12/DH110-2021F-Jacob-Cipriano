## Introduction:
The purpose of this project is to redesign the New York State Library Website into a mobile-app focused on accessibility and access to resources. I was motivated to design an app for this website because I noticed several issues, primarily regarding acessibility. It felt like the website was easy to use for those already familiar with the resources, but for those looking for new access to infomration, the process could by labyrinthine and sometimes information could not be easily accessed. 

I designed  a web app that would make it easier to learn about two main functions, the NovelNY program and the Genealogy stystem. I am basing these activities on the personas of two individuals: one who is a mother looking to educate her son about NovelNY, and another who is an older man looking to start consrtucting a family tree.
I hope that this can contribute to the New York State Library by demonstrating an effective way to display and communicate information to a new audience. .

## Design statement 
Through this design prototype, I hope to         What is the issue and Why do you think it is important to resolve that issue by your project? 

## Competitor analysis 
Before designing or even conceptualizing a new project, it was necessary to first study the original New York State Library Website and conduct a heuristic evaluation. I was able to find a number of issues with the layout and format of the text, along with a number of interactive items that didn't appear interactive and did not create a clear logic of interaction.

By conducting this evaluation, I was able to better grasp what primary challenges I was facing, what angle I wanted to approach this challenge, and how much I should take on for the scope of this project. While I could have decided to apprach a "fix" from a number of angles, perhaps by creating a better collections page, or designing a better way to contact the collections department, this evaluation showed me my greatest issue with the website: a lack of context, particularly surrounding two major areas. User research would further illuminate these issues to me.

## User research 
To best understand what needed to be changed with the original NYSL website, I conducted usablility testing with a participant over the phone and I asked them to complete certain tasks. I also asked about their general reception to the website: what they liked/disliked about it, what aws aesthetically pleasing, etc. This resulted in a great dialogue about what could be fixed. While my participant had little trouble finding particular sections of the website, they complained about a lack of information or available context. They also complained about the website's uneven layout, though praised its clean look. Overall, I learned through this user research exactly what I needed to focu on when designing my prototype: particularly, access to information.
